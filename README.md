## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd forum
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Setup**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:
    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    ```

### 🗄️ Database Setup (Critical)

This project uses Supabase as the backend. You need to set up the database schema before running the app.

1.  Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**.
2.  Open the **SQL Editor**.
3.  Copy the contents of `supabase_schema.sql` from this project's root directory.
4.  Paste and **Run** the SQL command.
    - This creates the `profiles`, `posts`, `comments`, and `votes` tables.
    - It also sets up Row Level Security (RLS) policies and triggers.

> **Important**: If you created a user account _before_ running this migration, that user won't have a profile. You should sign out and create a new account to ensure all triggers fire correctly.

### Running the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit and end-to-end tests.

### Unit Tests (Vitest)
Unit tests cover component logic, state management, and utility functions.
```bash
npm test
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
End-to-end tests verify critical user flows like login and signup.
```bash
# First, ensure browsers are installed
npx playwright install

# Run the tests
npm run test:e2e
```
